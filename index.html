	Max came to, on his knees in what looked like a big canvas tent. The tent was lit by a single lantern to his side, it was still full dark outside. There was a bedroll made of some kind of animal hide to his right, piled next to it was the leather top, skirt and heavy boots that the orc had been wearing. His head was still ringing from the powerful headbutt. He tried to move, but his hands were tied behind him around the center pole of the big tent. He realized he was naked. He heard movement, something approaching the tent from outside. He struggled a bit, but it was no use. 

The big woman appeared in the triangle of the doorway where two of the canvas sheets parted. She ducked to enter the tent, she too was completely naked. Max wasn’t able to make it out in the light from the campfire, but now he was able to see her very clearly. Her skin was olive green, was she an orc? He had never seen an orc before, only heard stories about them. Nobody had seen anything like an orc in two generations. That would explain her incredible size and strength. Little beads of water stood on her skin and reflected the lamp light making her glitter, her long, black hair hung in fat wet strands. She grabbed the bulk of it and twisted, making a small dribble of water come forth and fall to the grass below.

She was impressive, a mountain of a woman. Or rather she was a woman made from the stuff of mountains. Curves hewn from stone. She was covered in muscles and scars. She could crush his skull with her thighs alone. Her stomach rippled, every muscle plainly visible. Her breasts were godlike. If god had tits, they look like these tits, Max thought. Despite their size they were perfectly formed, giant, round, green monoliths of flesh. She knelt down in front of Max. The whites of her eyes were still blood red. Sophie, still hitching a ride in her. The orc’s face was completely human, if it wasn’t for her insane size and green skin Max thought there wouldn’t be any difference at all. Her eyes were some dark shade of brown difficult to make out with all the red. He had heard that orcs had tusks like wild boar, but she didn’t have anything like that at all. As far as he could tell her teeth were just like his. Then he noticed her ears, they were pointed, just like the elves, or at least that’s what he was told. Are the Elves real too? Max wondered.

“All these interruptions are very annoying, but I will have my satisfaction.” The Sophie Orc said. “Big girl here has a little something that I want to try out, something that I have heard about but never seen, and she has it…somehow, stole it from the master…somehow. We don’t have a lot of time left, so let’s get started.” 

“Sophie, I know that’s you in there. They will find you, the men that the king sent. They were out there with us.”

“Not me, alas, my time is done. All that I have left to do now is…scratch an itch.”

The Sophie Orc got up, and moved around behind Max and rummaged around looking for something. “There it is,” she said and came back around to face him kneeling down again. She held up a big, thick, gold ring about two inches across. 

“This is something very special and very old. It is priceless, no one living today has the skill to reproduce it.”

Max didn’t think the thing looked very impressive, just a big gold ring.

The Sophie Orc crept closer to Max, who started to protest but then she grabbed the back of his head with one big hand and flexed her massive bicep, shoving his face into her enormous breasts, each larger than his whole head. The Orc’s skin had a lovely musk that was deep, sensual and sweet all at once. The green skin was smooth, and thick, and taught. He could feel her hard nipples pressing against the flesh at his cheek like a fingertip, rubbing back and forth. The foreign smell of her was intoxicating. She reached down with her free hand and grabbed his cock which was already starting to engorge. She slipped the gold ring onto his growing member. He struggled, she fell back a little and grabbed him by the throat with the hand that had been behind his head. She didn’t choke him, just held him there pinned against the tent post. A reminder that she was in charge now. He said nothing. He felt himself growing harder and harder against the cold metal, warming it as his blood flowed south. He felt betrayed by his penis. Foul thing, he thought, do I have any control over you at all? She gently stroked his cock with that big strong hand. He felt something happen to his cock, a sensation he had never felt before, nothing painful and he didn't think it was anything that the Sophie orc was doing. It was swelling in some odd way, felt like there was somehow more of it.

The Sophie orc looked down at his member. “Interesting,” she said.
 
Max looked down. The gold ring was firmly seated at the base of his dick. He was expecting to see that, but everything else about that part of him had become disturbingly alien. It had grown huge in every dimension. The shaft was the same green as the Orc’s skin, the girth of it completely filling the ring, little nubs ran up either side. The head of his cock was the only part that was still mostly pink, but was nearly fist sized, and was flared like some kind of helm. Max was horrified. He felt faint. 

“What have you done to me?”

“Dont worry love, it’s just an Orc cock.” She gave the base of his dick one final squeeze, and gave the head a playful little slap making it wave at her. She then turned from him and went down on all fours and started backing herself up to him. Oh god, Max thought, she’s gonna make me fuck her. As she crept to him he noticed that she even had scars on her bottom including what looked like a bite mark. She backed her meaty ass up to his hips, spread her knees a little so she could get the angle right as she was much taller than he was, and reached around to direct his mutated cock into her. She spit into her other hand, and reaching down, parted her black bush exposing the pink of her pink vagina and rubbed the spittle into herself. She grabbed the base of his cock, bent it downwards to meet her slit then slowly but steadily pressed herself against him. Her back was arched high, muscles flexing, her head lay upon her folded arms on the grass, hair spread over them. She kept the pressure on until she was pressed tight against Max’s hips. He was completely buried inside her. The heat and grip of her was amazing. When their hips touched he felt a shudder run through the bulk of her and she let out a sound that was equal parts whimper and growl. Then she pulled up so that the head of his monster cock was the only thing left inside her, then slammed her hips back down forcefully, slamming Max’s ass against the post, rattling it. She let out a moan and did it again, and again. One hell of a way to lose my virginity, Max thought. He thought she might shatter his hips if she kept up like this, he already thought that his ass was bruised from being smashed against the post. She reached a hand down between her legs and started rubbing herself as she continued pounding on him. She was panting against the grass now. Harder, and faster. The whole tent was shuddering. She reached up with her free hand and dug her fingers into the ground, grabbing a fistful of grass and earth. She let out another deep growl, louder and angrier this time. She then put both of her hands down on the grass and dug her fingers in to get a better grip. She started smashing his hips even harder, growling and pushing against the earth, back muscles flexing. He could feel her juices dripping from his balls as they slapped against her with every powerful thrust. The smell of her musk wafted up to him. Now he thought that she really might shatter his hips. He felt heat quickly building and spreading from his spine to his head, and then reaching through his whole body, building with every thrust. He was going to cum. She drew in a breath and gave a few more shaky thrusts, then she buried his cock all the way down to the base and left it there. She was trembling inside and out. He came, the world went wavy, his ears were ringing. His rock hard penis pulsed hard over and over. His heart was pounding and his breath was jagged. He felt a shudder run up his body, rattling him against the post. Her juices were steadily running down his hanging balls. Her arms gave out and she collapsed in a heap on the ground before him, his cock came out of her with a soft little pop. She lay on the ground shuddering for a moment and then was still. 

Max was still shuddering himself, vision blurry and ears ringing, then his head cleared. The Sophie orc was passed out. He tried his bound hands again and found that they had come a little loose amidst all the bashing. He thought he could get his hands out. He only had to get one out, then it would be easy to free the other one. He worked his wrists back and forth and eventually got one hand free. Then he was easily able to work the knot on the other one and free it. He suddenly remembered his horrific cock, he looked down, terrified at what he might find. But everything was back to normal if not covered in the orc’s slick. Below was the ring, laying in a pool of the same stuff. He picked it up, it was satisfyingly heavy. He quickly decided to get out of the tent and away. He got to his feet and then scanned the tent for his clothes. He didn’t see them. Shit, he thought, Fuck it, I’m not waiting around for her to wake up.
